Things I learnt regarding learning languages
============
I’ve always been convinced that to learn language is ***not to learn the rules by heart, but to understand them***, so here are my tips based on that:

#### 1. Native speakers are your best resource.
* Some may disagree due to them often not being aware of certain grammar rules, but that's the point. ***Learn the usage, not the rules.***
* Rules will come naturally to you when you analyze them for yourself based on using the language.

#### 2. I've been learning Russian for almost 2 years now and my teacher has been focusing on remembering the rules.
* As if that's the best way to learn the language. So we didn't have much access to any context, not to mention poorly made textbooks. but now that I've become familiar with lots of usage, I don't need to stress about the rules, but ***base the grammar on previous, similiar contexts***.

#### 3. You don't need the rules unless you're majoring philology.
* For real, I understand that it's not your native language, but what's so bad about treating it as one? ***Learn it just like kids would.*** use it.

#### 4. About using it, put yourself in native speaker’s position.
* Change the language of your fav sites, talk to people even if you don't know much yet, stop stressing about grammar.
* ***Imagine people talking to you without using cases, conjugations - you're still gonna understand them,*** so why not start with that yourself?

Lyrics are also a great help when learning a language, I suggest *Spotify*. Here are some of the playlists:
